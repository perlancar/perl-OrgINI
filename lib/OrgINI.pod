=head1 SPECIFICATION VERSION

0.1


=head1 STATUS

First version of specification. There might still be incompatible changes before
1.0.


=head1 ABSTRACT

OrgINI is a configuration file format. It is Org [1] (a highly flexible
structured plain text file format) with some rules to make it easily convertible
to INI, specifically a subset of IOD (INI On Drugs) [2].

The goal is to create a simple configuration format that is convenient to write
by human.


=head1 NOTATION

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in RFC 2119.


=head1 RATIONALE

The Org format is highly flexible and is commonly used to write rich notes that
can contain agenda, links, todo items, tables, and so on. It is also convenient
to write, particularly in Emacs. Being a plain text format with open
specification, it is portable and free from vendor lock-in. It is not, however,
popular as a configuration file format because it is too flexible and there are
few(er) parsers for it.

INI, however, is a very popular configuration format. It is also a plain text
format and simple, both syntax-wise and semantic-wise (the content can be
represented as a two-level hash structure).

OrgINI is a convention to make an Org file more easily convertible to IOD (INI
on Drugs) format. The use case is for users to write configuration in OrgINI
format and programs to read (and/or write) the configuration in OrgINI or in INI
format.


=head1 SPECIFICATION

A configuration file is a plain text file in Org markup. Org heading will become
IOD section. Org definition list will become key-value pairs.

=head2 Heading

Org heading will become IOD section.

Multilevel heading will be encoded using absolute path notation with C<[> as
the path separator character.

IOD section can contain backslash string encoding (C<\xN>, C<\n>, C<\t>, C<\\>)
to encode a Unicode character with a certain codepoint. The section name will be
decoded when IOD is converted back to Org.

When converting an Org heading, C<[> and C<]> characters must be encoded into
C<\x5b> and C<\x5d>, respectively.

Example, this Org:

  * heading1
  ** heading2
  *** heading3
  ** heading4 [2025-06-19 Thu]
  **** heading5 [

will convert to this IOD:

 [heading1]
 [heading1[heading2]
 [heading1[heading2[heading3]
 [heading1[heading4 \x5b2025-06-19 Thu\x5d]
 [heading1[heading4 \x5b2025-06-19 Thu\x5d[[heading5 \x5b]

=head2 Definition list

Org definition list will become IOD key-value pairs.

When converting to IoD, C<=> in term of definition list must be encoded to
C<\x3d>.

Newlines and substructures under the term must be encoded using backslash string
encoding.

Example, this Org:

  - foo :: value1
  - bar\ :: value2
  - baz= :: value3
  - qux :: a long long long
      line
  - quux ::
    + another :: sub
    + definition :: list

will convert to this IOD:

  foo = value1
  bar\\ = value2
  baz\x3d = value3
  qux = a long long long\n  line
  quux = \n  + another :: sub\n  + definition :: list

Note that for simplicity, built-in IOD encoding is not used. Instead, backslash
string encoding is used.

=head2 Additional stuffs

When converting to IOD, additional elements in Org not explicitly specified in
this specification should be ignored.

Example, this Org:

  +#TODO: TODO | CLOSED OLD CANTUSE
  some description text
  some description text

  * category1
  - foo :: 1
  - bar :: 2
  - baz :: 3

  some text.
  ** subcategory1
  - foo :: 2
  ** subcategory2 > subsubcategory
  - foo :: 3
  - log ::
    + [2025-06-18] :: change foo to 3
    + [2025-07-17] :: remove bar
  * category2

will convert to this IOD:

  [category1]
  foo = 1
  bar = 2
  baz = 3
  [category1[subcategory1]
  foo = 2
  [category1[subcategory2[subsubcategory]
  foo = 3
  log = \n  + [2025-06-18] :: change foo to 3\n    + [2025-07-17] :: remove bar
  [category2]
